# DATATYPES-IN-C-PLUS-PLUS
# Aim:
To understand the datatypes and know the amount of memory alloted.

# Theory:
There are 5 main and 3 derived datatypes.

int: stores whole numbers. eg., 10,0,-1
float: stores decimal numbers with single precision. eg., 3.14159
double: stores decimal numbers with double precision. eg., 9.81 (it is more accurate than float)
char: stores single character. eg., 'a','$'
bool: stores either true or false values. eg., true, false
Derived:

Arrays
Pointers
Classes

This C++ program demonstrates the use of various data types and their sizes. The program does the following:

Variable Declaration: It declares variables of different data types: int, float, char, double, string, and bool.

User Input: It prompts the user to enter values for each of these variables.

Display Values and Sizes: After collecting the input, the program prints each variable's value along with its size in bytes using the sizeof operator.

This exercise illustrates basic input and output operations, variable declaration, and size determination for different data types in C++.
