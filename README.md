# DATATYPES-IN-C-PLUS-PLUS
This C++ program demonstrates the use of various data types and their sizes. The program does the following:

Variable Declaration: It declares variables of different data types: int, float, char, double, string, and bool.

User Input: It prompts the user to enter values for each of these variables.

Display Values and Sizes: After collecting the input, the program prints each variable's value along with its size in bytes using the sizeof operator.

This exercise illustrates basic input and output operations, variable declaration, and size determination for different data types in C++.
